# Game Of Life

The Game of Life isn't really a game because there is no player. The game is on a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any cell with less than 2 neighbours dies.  
Any cell with more than 3 neighbours dies.  
Any cell with two or three neighbours stay alive.  
Any dead cell with three neighbours will come to life.
